### About the Project

This project revolves around **Château de Chambord**, and was created using **Blender** and **Unity**. The AR application utilizes marker-based AR, where users can scan a printed image (included in the repository) with their mobile device to view a 3D representation of the Château and its features.

The project features:
- **AR Interactivity**: Users can scan the marker to bring the Château de Chambord to life in augmented reality.
- **Model Features**: The AR model includes animations, such as horses running in front of the château.
- **Historical Content**: The app provides information about the Château and its history.
- **Double Spiral Staircase**: As an added feature, users can view the double-helix staircase, which has been suggested to be designed by **Leonardo da Vinci**.
